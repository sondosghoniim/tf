Findings:
• Age Distribution: Most players fall within the mid-20s, with an average age of 25, 
and a minority of players are older than 35.
• Player Ratings: Most of the player ratings range between 60 and 80, with very few 
reaching above 90, indicating that exceptional players are rare.
• Representation by Nationality: Spain, Germany, and Brazil are the most 
represented countries in the dataset.
• Age and Rating Correlation: Younger players often have higher potential but tend 
to have lower current ratings compared to older players.
• Wages by Club: Clubs like Barcelona and Real Madrid offer significantly higher 
wages compared to other teams, reflecting their top-tier status.
• Position and Physical Attributes: Defenders are generally taller than players in 
other positions, likely due to the physical demands of their role.
• Missing Data Handling: Missing data was handled by filling in values using the 
median or mode to ensure data completeness and accuracy.
• Outlier Management: Outliers in wage and value were addressed to reduce their 
impact on the analysis.
• Categorical Features: Categorical variables such as position and foot preference 
were converted into binary features for better model performance.
• Data Partitioning: The dataset was split into training and testing sets to facilitate 
reliable model evaluation
